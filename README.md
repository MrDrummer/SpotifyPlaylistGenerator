# SpotifyPlaylistGenerator

## Exercise
My goal for this project is to learn how Authenticated apps work in C#, as well as a lot of concepts involved in web development.

- OAuth2 flow and the Authorization and Authentication services
- Project structure
- Best practices when structuring classes, using interfaces etc.
- Learn the DevOps side - how to host the site, DB and deployments

I wanted to do something with the Spotify API anyways, so I figured I may as well "kill two birds with one stone".

## App Concept
I want to be able to reorder, dedupe and generate Spotify playlists based on my specific taste in music.

I notice that Spotify does a good job of recommending similar artists via specific tracks, but often I only have 1 track of this similar artist, and miss out on an entire Album of awesome songs, and in some cases, their whole library!
